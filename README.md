# Yet Another Middleware for Redux

Not that Redux community strive for more middlewares, but I'm not fully satisfied with the current standards such as `thunk` or `sagas`. This middleware initially appeared as an internal instrument, but I left the project. To keep in touch, I finally decided to make a full-on package out of it. I'll keep implementation incremental to keep track of the evolution. The proper documentation will be created when the project reaches the final state (expect a couple commits from now).

This is the first package I create. So any proposals on structure or format are welcome!
